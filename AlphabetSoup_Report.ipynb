    "This neural network model would be more accurate with optimizing the model even more. Regrettably, after running the initial model in Google Colab, it seems the model kept crashing and would not complete. Regardless, with more modifying and close monitoring of how the data changes with adding more layers, this model is great at predicting the target. A different model that could also be used is a decision tree which is a simpler approach."
